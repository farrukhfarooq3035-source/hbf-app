# Workaround: Trigger Vercel deploy on push to main (when Git integration auto-deploy fails)
# Setup: Vercel → hbf-app → Settings → Git → Deploy Hooks → Create (branch: main)
#        GitHub → repo Settings → Secrets → Actions → VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK = hook URL

name: Deploy to Vercel on Push

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:

    steps:
      - name: Trigger Vercel Deploy
        if: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK != '' }}
        run: curl -sSf -X POST "${{ secrets.VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK }}"
